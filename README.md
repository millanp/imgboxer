# imgboxer
A tool to quickly highlight and tag portions of images (REQUIRES CHROME)

**The concept**<br>
This is a system to add "tags" to certain regions of input images, then output the tag names and locations in a JSON file. It is designed to be used quickly, with fast image loading and keyboard shortcuts.

**Instructions for use**<br>
1. Put all input images under a single directory. Must contain image files only, but subdirectories are allowed.<br>
2. Create a .tags file somewhere within this directory. This is a newline separated list of tags that may be applied to different sections of the images.<br>
3. Go to http://millanp.github.io/imgboxer to use the tool. If you want to download it for offline use, clone this repository to your machine and open index.html in Chrome.
